# Virus spread micro model

This code simulates how a virus spreads. People are Python objects
and they can have friends. If friends are infected, the person 
can get the disease. Each day an infected can die according to a model.
Some people recover and become immune. Some random people isolate.

Feel free to play around and change some of the parameters.
